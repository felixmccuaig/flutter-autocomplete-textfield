 ## Breaking Changes

 TextField is set by default to call onSubmitted on a suggestion tap and also to clear the TextField on submit.

 These can both be disabled with submitOnSuggestionTap and clearOnSubmit respectively.
 
 ## Usage
 
 AutoCompleteTextField supports any data type suggestions
 
``` dart
 new AutoCompleteTextField<YOURDATATYPE>()
 ```
 
The suggestions parameter must have data that matches `<YOURDATATYPE>`
 
 A global key of type `GlobalKey<AutoCompleteTextFieldState<T>>` is required so that the `clear()` method can be called to clear AutoCompleteTextField.

# Strings and itemFilter

Filtering is case sensitive so when using strings a common implementation of itemFilter is .   

```` dart
itemFilter: (item, query) {
  return item.toLowerCase().startsWith(query.toLowerCase());
}
 ```
